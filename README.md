## Usage
Firstly, set up the server on your host or service.
`python3 server.py`

This will start the server loop and wait for connections from clients and parse received messages.

Then on the client you just run the app.
`python3 client.py`

You will be prompted for a username and connect to the server and can begin chatting.
